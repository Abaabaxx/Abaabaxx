## About Me

I am an undergraduate student with a strong passion for embodied intelligence.
 Through multiple national-level robotics competitions, I have designed, built, and fine-tuned complete robotic systems.
 These hands-on experiences revealed the limitations of traditional methods (e.g., **fragile perception, Sim-to-Real gaps**), and ignited my enthusiasm for research in **learning-driven robotics**.
 I aspire to transition from being an **engineer** to becoming a **researcher**, exploring more robust and intelligent paradigms for robotics.
